# How to Use Flowcode 6 Keygen to Generate Serial Keys for Flowcode Pro 6
 
Flowcode Pro 6 is a graphical programming IDE that allows you to develop highly functional electrical, electronic and electromechanical systems for microcontroller based systems and for Windows PCs and tablets[^2^]. It is a product of Matrix Multimedia, a manufacturer of microcontroller compilers[^1^].

If you want to use Flowcode Pro 6 without purchasing a license, you can use a keygen to generate serial keys for it. A keygen is an administration/security/penetration tool that can brute force key generation[^3^]. This can help you to bypass the activation process of Flowcode Pro 6 and use it for free.
 
However, using a keygen is illegal and unethical, as it violates the terms and conditions of Flowcode Pro 6. It may also expose your computer to malware or viruses that can harm your system or steal your data. Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen to generate serial keys for Flowcode Pro 6.
 
The best way to use Flowcode Pro 6 is to purchase a license from the official website of Flowcode[^2^]. This will ensure that you get the latest updates, support and features of Flowcode Pro 6. You will also be supporting the developers of Flowcode Pro 6 and their efforts to create a powerful and user-friendly graphical programming IDE.

In this article, we will show you how to use Flowcode Pro 6 to create a simple LED blinking program for an Arduino Uno board. You will need the following items:
 
- A computer with Flowcode Pro 6 installed.
- An Arduino Uno board and a USB cable.
- An LED and a 220 ohm resistor.
- A breadboard and some jumper wires.

Follow these steps to create the program:

1. Launch Flowcode Pro 6 and create a new project. Select Arduino Uno as the target device and C as the programming language.
2. Drag and drop an LED component from the components panel to the design area. Double-click on it and change its name to LED1. Click OK.
3. Drag and drop a delay component from the components panel to the design area. Double-click on it and change its value to 1000 ms. Click OK.
4. Connect the LED1 component to pin 13 of the Arduino Uno board. Connect the delay component to both inputs of the LED1 component.
5. Click on the compile button to generate the C code for the program. Click on the program button to upload the code to the Arduino Uno board.
6. Connect the LED and the resistor in series between pin 13 and ground of the Arduino Uno board using the breadboard and the jumper wires.
7. Plug in the USB cable to the Arduino Uno board and your computer. You should see the LED blinking on and off every second.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a simple LED blinking program using Flowcode Pro 6.

In this article, we will also show you how to modify the program to change the blinking frequency of the LED. You will need to change the value of the delay component in Flowcode Pro 6. Follow these steps to modify the program:

1. Open the existing project in Flowcode Pro 6 or create a new one with the same components and connections as before.
2. Double-click on the delay component and change its value to a different number of milliseconds. For example, if you want the LED to blink twice as fast, change the value to 500 ms. If you want the LED to blink half as fast, change the value to 2000 ms. Click OK.
3. Click on the compile button to generate the new C code for the program. Click on the program button to upload the new code to the Arduino Uno board.
4. You should see the LED blinking at a different frequency according to the value of the delay component.

You have successfully modified the program to change the blinking frequency of the LED using Flowcode Pro 6.
  
In this article, we will also show you how to add more LEDs and make them blink in a pattern. You will need to add more LED and delay components in Flowcode Pro 6 and connect them to different pins of the Arduino Uno board. Follow these steps to add more LEDs and make them blink in a pattern:

1. Open the existing project in Flowcode Pro 6 or create a new one with the same components and connections as before.
2. Drag and drop another LED component from the components panel to the design area. Double-click on it and change its name to LED2. Click OK.
3. Drag and drop another delay component from the components panel to the design area. Double-click on it and change its value to a different number of milliseconds than the first delay component. For example, if you want LED2 to blink every half second, change the value to 500 ms. Click OK.
4. Connect the LED2 component to pin 12 of the Arduino Uno board. Connect the second delay component to both inputs of the LED2 component.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for as many LEDs as you want to add. Make sure each LED has a different name and is connected to a different pin of the Arduino Uno board. Also make sure each delay component has a different value than the others.
6. Click on the compile button to generate the new C code for the program. Click on the program button to upload the new code to the Arduino Uno board.
7. Connect each LED and resistor in series between its corresponding pin and ground of the Arduino Uno board using the breadboard and jumper wires.
8. Plug in the USB cable to the Arduino Uno board and your computer. You should see all LEDs blinking in a pattern according to their delay values.

You have successfully added more LEDs and made them blink in a pattern using Flowcode Pro 6.

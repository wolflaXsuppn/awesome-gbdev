# How to Download and Use the SMD Code Book for Electronics Repair
 
If you are an electronics technician or a hobbyist who likes to repair LCD/LED TVs, laptops, computers, and other electronic devices, you may have encountered many surface-mount devices (SMDs) that have different markings and codes. Sometimes, it can be hard to identify the type, characteristics, or pinout of these SMDs without a reference book or a datasheet.

Fortunately, there is a free resource that can help you with this problem: the SMD Code Book. The SMD Code Book is a PDF file that contains SMD marking codes for almost every SMD component available on the market. It lists over 3,400 device codes in alphabetical order, together with type numbers, device characteristics or equivalents and pinout information[^1^].
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and use the SMD Code Book for your electronics repair projects. We will also provide some alternative sources of SMD code books that you can check out.
  
## How to Download the SMD Code Book
 
Downloading the SMD Code Book is very easy and simple. You just need to follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [this website](https://www.electroschematics.com/smd-code-book-and-marking-codes/) where you can find the link to download the SMD Code Book[^1^].
2. Click on the "download the SMD code book" link and save the PDF file to your computer or device.
3. Open the PDF file with any PDF reader software or app.
4. You can also print the PDF file if you want to have a hard copy of the SMD Code Book.

## How to Use the SMD Code Book
 
Using the SMD Code Book is also very easy and simple. You just need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the package style of the SMD device that you want to look up. For example, if it is a transistor, it could be a SOT-23, SOT-223, TO-92, etc.
2. Note the ID code printed on the device. For example, if it is a transistor with a marking code of "1AM", write it down.
3. Look up the ID code in the alphabetical listing of the SMD Code Book by looking for the first character in the left column. For example, if it is "1AM", look for "1" in the left column.
4. Find the matching ID code in the right column and read the corresponding type number, device characteristics or equivalents and pinout information. For example, if it is "1AM", you will find that it is a BC846A NPN transistor with a hFE of 110-450 and a Vceo of 65V.
5. You can also use the CTRL + F shortcut to search for a certain ID code in the PDF file if you don't want to scroll through all the pages.

## Alternative Sources of SMD Code Books
 
If you want to have more options for finding SMD codes and information, you can also check out these alternative sources of SMD code books:

- [Soft4led](https://www.soft4led.com/smd-code-book-pdf-download/): This website provides a collection of different SMD code books that you can download for free[^2^]. They also have other useful resources for electronics repair such as firmware files, schematics, circuit diagrams, COF IC datasheets, TV service menu codes, TV remote control codes, etc.
- [Vdocuments](https://vdocuments.net/the-smd-code-book-5584551d4b653.html): This website provides another version of the SMD code book that you can view online or download as a PDF file[^3^]. It has more than 4,000 device codes and covers more package styles than the previous one.
